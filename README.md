Data Visualization of NYC Airbnb Dataset 
Final Project Report  

Introduction: 

  Airbnb, Inc. is a company based out of San Francisco, California. It was launched in 2008 by  Brian Chesky, Nathan Blecharczyk, and Joe Gebbia
  as an online platform for finding and renting houses, apartments, and individual rooms, all of which are available through a website and mobile 
  application. Airbnb Inc. earns a profit through service fees that are associated with individual bookings, and therefore do not own and are not 
  responsible for the properties rented by hosts.Since 2008, visitors and hosts have utilised Airbnb to broaden travel options and offer a more unique
  and personalized way of traveling. Airbnb has grown into a one-of-a-kind service that is used and recognized all over the world. Data analysis on the
  millions of Airbnb postings is a critical aspect for the organization. These listings generate a large amount of data, which can be analyzed and used 
  for a variety of purposes, including security, business decisions, understanding customer and provider (host) behavior and performance on the platform,
  guiding marketing initiatives, implementing innovative additional services, and much more.
